# iCn3D in Jupyter Notebook, Windowing Data management, Reference numbering and Mapping 

<b>iCn3D in Jupyter Notebook</b>: 

Jupyter Notebook is a convenient way to do data analysis. It will be great if iCn3D can be embedded in Jupyter Notebook with all features. 

The current preliminary version of icn3dpy has several issues. 

1. It works in Chrome, but not Safari. 

2. After “view”, the page asked whether to leave the page. 

3. When refreshing the page, the page keeps refreshing.

The instructions are listed under the directory Jupyter Notebook in this depository. icn3dpy is released at https://pypi.org/project/icn3dpy/.

<b>Windowing Data management</b>: 

As the program grows in functionality, it inevitably grows in complexity.  It is imperative that we think about issues on usability.  For example we now can generate many windows containing valuable information that can overwhelm non expert users, or even expert users.  Managing these windows efficiently becomes important, as is managing the data they contain for project management, publication, storage, for second level analysis, etc.   A group reflecting on usability, complexity, prototyping new user interface functions or improving them, such as multi windowing, project and data management, etc. is welcome to come forward for a hackathon project …  

In particular, we can generate windows with molecular interactions represented as 2D networks, Tables, 3D depiction, 1D sequence track windows, for one or two mapped structures.  All these windows are related, synchronized in data.  If 2 structures are mapped, they can be seen in 3D as superimposed, but also now side by side.  At this stage, we need smart window management especially if we need to synchronize visualization of windows of 1D 2D 3D or Tables Representations.  By the same token, comparing data across structures  will become important.

You can click the arrow icon on the dialog to minimize or expand the window.
